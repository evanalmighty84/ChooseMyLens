          For higher prescriptions this design curves the front of the lens as well as the back in order to offset optical distortions that typically reduce the quality of vision, and expanding visual clarity particularly at the edges of the lens. These slight curvature changes on the front surface also significantly reduce the bulge or thickness of a plus power lens and reduce magnification of the wearer's eyes.

Tact lenses are specifically designed to minimize the effects of CVS, including eye fatigue, dry eyes, and neck pain caused by working at the computer.

          The best anti-reflective in the world just got extreme!  Sharper vision and elimination of glare reduces eye fatigue and improves vision both in artificial office light and for night driving.  Harder to scratch than glass, maximum scratch resistance ensures clear vision and longer lens life.  Fingerprints, water spots and dirt contribute to diminished view. Since dirt doesn't adhere to our lenses, and they resist fingerprints and water, cleaning is easier and vision is clear and crisp.

          Tinted lenses can't protect you from glare off water surfaces and snow, or even sunlight glinting through a windshield. Only polarized lenses eliminate reflected light before it can reach your eyes. These lenses not only provide 100% UV absorption, they're also remarkably scratch resistant. We incorporate polarizing properties in a natural gray for the optimal color contrast and enhancement. Polarizing single vision and progressive lens designs are both available in our standard plastic or our thinner, more lightweight lens materials.

          Every time you go outside it puts a strain on your eyes because they're forced to instantly adjust to brighter light. Photochromic lenses automatically darken when you step outside, and constantly adjust to the natural light of the day while providing constant UV light protection.  This lens treatment is available in Transitions, the world leader in advanced photochromic technology. We offer a complete selection of photochromic lens materials, colors and lens designs.

          Many people find direct sunlight too bright to be comfortable. During outdoor activities, the human eye can receive more light than usual. Healthcare professionals recommend eye protection whenever outside to protect the eyes from ultraviolet radiation, which can cause serious eye problems. The proper lens tint prevents strong light and UV rays from penetrating the eyes. Tint can make reading or working at a computer more comfortable, reduce glare when driving, and allow more visual clarity of objects. In addition to choice of color, the intensity of a tint can vary the result of your vision. Tint intensity is expressed as a percentage of the light it blocks. Because white light is made up of many colors, picking tints carefully can improve the performance of your eyewear in specific environments and activities.

          The material is the foundation of a lens. Thickness, weight, and impact resistance are all variables to consider. A specific gravity of 1.1 grams per cubic centimeter makes this the lightest lens material in the world; 19% lighter than standard plastic and up to 8% lighter than polycarbonate. The impact resistance quality of this material far exceeds FDA standards for industrial safety eyewear, providing superior safety for the wearer. It has superior tensile strength that is 6 times stronger than standard plastic making it 60 times more impact resistant than standard plastic lenses, which is ideal for drill-mount frames. The material also features built-in 100% protection against UV-A and UV-B rays.

          The material is the foundation of a lens. Thickness, weight, and impact resistance are all variables to consider. A specific gravity of 1.1 grams per cubic centimeter makes this the lightest lens material in the world; 19% lighter than standard plastic and up to 8% lighter than polycarbonate. The impact resistance quality of this material far exceeds FDA standards for industrial safety eyewear, providing superior safety for the wearer. It has superior tensile strength that is 6 times stronger than standard plastic making it 60 times more impact resistant than standard plastic lenses, which is ideal for drill-mount frames. The material also features built-in 100% protection against UV-A and UV-B rays.

            The best anti-reflective in the world just got extreme!  Sharper vision and elimination of glare reduces eye fatigue and improves vision both in artificial office light and for night driving.  Harder to scratch than glass, maximum scratch resistance ensures clear vision and longer lens life.  Fingerprints, water spots and dirt contribute to diminished view. Since dirt doesn't adhere to our lenses, and they resist fingerprints and water, cleaning is easier and vision is clear and crisp.

            Tinted lenses can't protect you from glare off water surfaces and snow, or even sunlight glinting through a windshield. Only polarized lenses eliminate reflected light before it can reach your eyes. These lenses not only provide 100% UV absorption, they're also remarkably scratch resistant. We incorporate polarizing properties in a natural gray for the optimal color contrast and enhancement. Polarizing single vision and progressive lens designs are both available in our standard plastic or our thinner, more lightweight lens materials.

            Yellow provides the maximum light transmission of any polarized lens. It increases contrast and filters blue light and is used in low light conditions such as overcast or cloudy days.

        <copy>
          This design provides clear vision from edge to edge of the lens neutralizing distortions. Applying the prescription to both sides of the lens shapes them to the specific rotation of your eyes to account for actual physiological functions like eye movement so you can focus in all directions.

          This is the lightest plastic lens material in the world; 19% lighter than standard plastic and up to 8% lighter than polycarbonate. The impact resistance of this material exceeds FDA standards for industrial safety eyewear, providing superior safety for you even in your best day or evening wear. Phoenix plastic comes systematically with an ultra-tough scratch resistant coating and also features built-in 100% protection against UV-A and UV-B rays.

            The best anti-reflective in the world just got extreme!  Sharper vision and elimination of glare reduces eye fatigue and improves vision both in artificial office light and for night driving.  Harder to scratch than glass, maximum scratch resistance ensures clear vision and longer lens life.  Fingerprints, water spots and dirt contribute to diminished view. Since dirt doesn't adhere to our lenses, and they resist fingerprints and water, cleaning is easier and vision is clear and crisp.

            Tinted lenses can't protect you from glare off water surfaces and snow, or even sunlight glinting through a windshield. Only polarized lenses eliminate reflected light before it can reach your eyes. These lenses not only provide 100% UV absorption, they're also remarkably scratch resistant. We incorporate polarizing properties in a natural gray for the optimal color contrast and enhancement. Polarizing single vision and progressive lens designs are both available in our standard plastic or our thinner, more lightweight lens materials.
